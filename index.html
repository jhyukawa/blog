        <h3 class="post-title">Integrating with Web APIs</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>
            This by far has been the most difficult part to add to my blog. It
            took me two days just to figure out how to connect to the API for
            <a href="https://giphy.com/" target="_blank">Giphy</a>. During the
            first day I had no idea what was and wasn't working. That's when I
            figured out the importance of using console.log to show what few
            parts of my code actually work. I was finally able to send the
            request by changing the async to false.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I got a JSON response, I used console.log to figure out how to
            get the embed URL from all the data that was sent back. I was happy
            that I was finally able to figure it out but my work on this project
            was not complete. I received a message on the console that said
            Synchronous request are a no no so I needed to figure out how to
            change it to an Asynchronous request. Unfortunately, when I changed
            async to true, the code stoped working completely. A couple
            days and a couple dozen articles later I was able to format the
            request to work while async is true.
          <p>
            Together with JavaScript and <a href="https://giphy.com">Giphy's</a>
            APIs I am able to give to you this random Gif generator. All you
            need to do is click the button and enjoy all the funny Gifs that
            <a href="https://giphy.com">Giphy</a> has to offer.

          <p>
            <script src="todaysdate.js"></script>
          </p>
          <p id="datetoday"></p>
          <script>
            var d = new Date();
            document.getElementById("datetoday").innerHTML = d.toDateString();
          </script>
          <p>
            Finally... It has been about two weeks since I first said I was
            learning JavaScript and I have now learned enought to add
            something to my blog. The <a href="https://getmimo.com"
            target="_blank"> Mimo </a> lesson didn't really even explain how to
            add my JavaScript functions to HTML. I have all this knowlege about
            how to create variables and loops but I had no idea how to save a
            function into a file and connect it into my blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            But enough ranting, let me explain what I was able to do. I figured
            out that there are three ways to add JavaScript to HTML:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Create a seperate JavaScript file and have an HTML line of code
              that points to the JS file</li>
            <li>Add the JavaScript code directly into the HTML file within the
               script & /script tags</li>
            <li>Pay a web developer to do it for you</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In case you were wondering, I didn't accidentally display the date
            twice. The first date uses the first method that I listed and the
            second date has the script directly in the HTML code. Both scripts I
            wrote should update to display the date that you are vistiting the
            blog so I will have to check back tomorrow to see if it works
          </P>

          <h3 class="post-title">Updates to Game and Blog</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>
              Hello again! I have made some major imporvements to my game. First,
              I added another level and a win screen that displays when you
              complete the game. I also added a restart game screen for when
              the player runs out of lives. There was a bug that prevented
              the player from taking damage from enemies and I finally figured
              out that the cause was a typo. I feel like something as small as
              misspelling one letter shouldn't prevent your whole code from
              not working but that's the way coding works. I wonder if
              software engineers should also need degrees in English to prevent
              mistakes like this from happening...
            </p>
            <p>
              Since I plan on making more games in the future, I have changed the
              "Game" link to "Games" in the header and made it a page that will
              list all the games I create. I hope that I will be able to create
              better games and maybe even get into the video industy. My
              girlfriend says she is proud of my progress and is really impressed
              by the blog and my first game. Hopefully I will keep progressing
              in my journey to become a software engineer.
            </p>

              The JavaScript lesson in <a href="https://getmimo.com" target="_blank">
              Mimo </a> didn't really provide me with enough information to build
              anything useful in my blog. The lesson is very similar to other
              introductions to object orientented programming languages and I
              feel like it doesn't provide students with enough working knowlege
              to be able to build anything. I will try to get some inspiration
              from other blogs to see if there is something that I can create
              for my own blog.
            </p>
            <p>
              But wait, I didn't just take the short JavaScript lesson since my
              last post. I also learned how to convert a game that I made into
              an html file so that I can have it as part of my blog. This was
              another track in mimo and one that I very much enjoyed. I hope you
              have fun playing my fake version of Mario lol. Click on the link
              below to take you to the game. I will also add a link at the top
              of my blog.

              In case you weren't able to tell, I was able to sucessfully
              add a GIF and a YouTube video. The gif was the same as adding
              any image or picture and YouTube had code that I could copy and
              paste into html. I am about to start the lessons in Mimo that
              cover JavaScript and I hope it will allow me to make my websites
              more dynamic. We will see what I can come up with since there
              aren't any more Mimo projects to help walk me through what to
              do.

              a relatively easy coding language to learn and it seems like I

              add a GIF and a video into the blog. If nothing shows up, I was

            <p>The <strong>Gold Challenge</strong> from Mimo is to create another
              blog post, so I am just copying the code from the previous post
              and changing the content.
            </p>
            <p>I would imaging that there is a different way to do it because
              if I keep doing it this way, the code will be extremly long on
              the index page. I will keep learning and hopefully find the
              correct way to set up this website.
