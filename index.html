              The JavaScript lesson in <a href="https://getmimo.com" target="_blank">
              Mimo </a> didn't really provide me with enough information to build
              anything useful in my blog. The lesson is very similar to other
              introductions to object orientented programming languages and I
              feel like it doesn't provide students with enough working knowlege
              to be able to build anything. I will try to get some inspiration
              from other blogs to see if there is something that I can create
              for my own blog.
            </p>
            <p>
              But wait, I didn't just take the short JavaScript lesson since my
              last post. I also learned how to convert a game that I made into
              an html file so that I can have it as part of my blog. This was
              another track in mimo and one that I very much enjoyed. I hope you
              have fun playing my fake version of Mario lol. Click on the link
              below to take you to the game. I will also add a link at the top
              of my blog.

              In case you weren't able to tell, I was able to sucessfully
              add a GIF and a YouTube video. The gif was the same as adding
              any image or picture and YouTube had code that I could copy and
              paste into html. I am about to start the lessons in Mimo that
              cover JavaScript and I hope it will allow me to make my websites
              more dynamic. We will see what I can come up with since there
              aren't any more Mimo projects to help walk me through what to
              do.

            <p>I have completed the Mimo track to make a website and this is the
              first post that I will create on my own, without any help. HTML is
              a relatively easy coding language to learn and it seems like I
              have mastered the basics so far. In this post I will attempt to
              add a GIF and a video into the blog. If nothing shows up, I was
              unable to figure it out.

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>The <strong>Gold Challenge</strong> from Mimo is to create another
              blog post, so I am just copying the code from the previous post
              and changing the content.
            </p>
            <p>I would imaging that there is a different way to do it because
              if I keep doing it this way, the code will be extremly long on
              the index page. I will keep learning and hopefully find the
              correct way to set up this website.
